                             junk food will not assist you in getting in shape. Fruits and vegetables are the finest thing to eat when getting into shape.
                              Apples, for case, do great work

<b class="bold">3. Tracking of Calories and Food intake Per Day</b>
<br>
Keeping track of how many calories you eat in a day will be helpful in arranging your physical working out. Ever wonder why bodybuilders', 
 body masses are so enormous? That's since they plan out their meals and take in more (solid) calories than the normal individual. On the other hand, 
losing weight and endeavoring for a skinnier physical makeup will involve more physical workouts than calories you ingest.

<br>
<b class="bold">4. Be Sure to Get Sleep</b>
<br>
Even though most of us have eight-hour employment/jobs during the day or night, it is crucial to get sufficient rest to revive the body's batteries.
 Six to eight hours of sleep will keep the body going all through the day, but in the event that you happen to feel tired at any point after coming home
  from work, by all means, take a 
little rest before working out. You should only rest for approximately a half-hour. This will prevent you from staying up later in the night.

<br>
<b class="bold">5. Stay Motivated</b>
<br>
The Positive mindset will help you to achive your goal.
push your body to the body you always wanted.

                                     No matter how bad your stomach is telling you to go for candy over healthy food, try to stay away from sweets. Sugar from candy will not help you get in shape. Even if it's just a single candy bar, one will eventually lead to another. Fruits and vegetables are the best thing to eat when getting into shape. Apples, for example, do a good job at making the stomach feel full for up to 3 to 4 hours. Green vegetables such as green beans and broccoli keep the digestive system clean and running.
                                     Also, stick to lean meats like turkey and chicken. Seafood, such 
        as, shrimp, and tilapia are also great alternatives. These foods are full of 
        protein and healthy nutrients to help keep muscles fit and ready for workouts.
         In addition, be sure to portion what you eat. Having a good metabolism comes from portioning meals. 
         Try to plan out eating six times a day and setting smaller portions, rather than having three large meals throughout the day. 
         This will also help you find yourself breathing smoother when working out rather than huffing and puffing for air. 
        This is because you will have less food in your digestive system, which means more energy is used toward your exercise.

                In addition, be sure to portion what you eat. Having a good metabolism comes from portioning meals. 
                Try to plan out eating six times a day and setting smaller portions, rather than having three large meals throughout the day. 
                This will also help you find yourself breathing smoother when working out rather than huffing and puffing for air. 
                This is because you will have less food in your digestive system, which means more energy is used toward your exercise.

                <b class="bold">4. Be Sure to Get Sleep</b>
                <br>
                Even though most of us have eight-hour jobs during the day or night, it is crucial to get
                 enough sleep to recharge the body's batteries. Six to eight hours of sleep will keep the 
                 body going throughout the day, but if you happen to feel tired at any point after coming
                  home from work, by all means take a small nap before exercising. You should only nap for
                   about a half hour. 
                This will prevent you from staying up later in the night.

                <b class="bold">5. Stay Motivated</b>
                <br>
                An important key to being in shape is to set goals and keep a positive mindset. 
                If you stay positive, you will
                 be able to push yourself to get that fit body you've always wanted.
